Cool water things to do in Rotterdam:
Go to Hoek Van Holland with the metro for a nice day at the beach, the beach is super long and big and is lovely for walks. Great for dogs
In Rotterdam you can surf in the canals, specifically RIF010 is a place with artificial waves to do urban surfing. Take the water taxi here, very touristic but fun.

Cool water things to do in Hamburg:
Swimming in the Dove Elbe, right outside of the city.
Riding pedal boat in the Außenalster right in the middle of the city.
Stand Up Paddling is also great.

Place to relax:
Kaifu-Bad, Eimsbüttel
Roots Yoga Studio im Grindel, perfect for good yoga sessions and meditation

Hamburg Cinemas:
Zeise , Abaton, and Passage are examples of smaller cinemas with a special selection of (often more political) movies and a beautiful flair.

Hamburg Theatres:
Theatres like Schauspielhaus, Thalia Theater, Kammerspiele, and Ernst-Deutsch-Theater all offer impressive plays throughout the year.

Place to avoid in Hamburg: 
The main train station at night
City centre on weekends or holidays, it's just too crowded
