## Description ##
Welcome to my City Guide Project for Hamburg (and partly Rotterdam)!
This is a collage of recommendations collected by students from the University of Hamburg and the University of Rotterdam, summarising the best places to visit and enjoy in the city. 
Whether it's small caf√©s, food spots, cinemas, or secret places to relax, there is  something for everyone here.
